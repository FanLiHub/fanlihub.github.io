Hi there, I am Fan Li (李帆), a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Artificial Intelligence (formerly the Unmanned Systems Technology Research Institute), Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU). My research lies at the intersection of computer vision and autonomous unmanned systems, with a focus on robust scene understanding under complex and shifting visual domains. Specifically, my research interests include:

- Generative-driven next-generation perception models

- Generalization of unmanned systems in complex and dynamic environments

- Robust visual understanding in open-world scenarios

- Multi-modal dynamic scene understanding


My research aims to enable robust and reliable visual perception and scene understanding for unmanned systems operating in complex and dynamic environments. This work serves to

I am always open to collaboration and interdisciplinary conversation.
You can explore my publications on Google Scholar or contact me at lifan.messages@gmail.com.

[[Better to Teach than to Give: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation via Agent Queries with Diffusion Model Guidance]](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v267/li25co.html)

**Fan Li**, Xuan Wang, Min Qi, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Yuelei Xu

Accepted at **ICML 2025** (Spotlight💡)

[**Project**](https://github.com/FanLiHub/QueryDiff) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- Developed an agent-query–driven framework for domain-generalized semantic segmentation, in which learnable agent queries act as an interface to inject diffusion-model priors into visual perception networks, thereby improving cross-domain generalization.
